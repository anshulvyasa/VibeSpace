üßæ Naming Convention Cheat Sheet
üîê Authentication / Logged-in User
Purpose	Name	Notes
Logged-in user ID	userId	Always use this for current user (from token/session)

üë§ User-to-User Interaction
Purpose	Name	Use Case Example
The user being followed	targetUserId	POST /follow/:targetUserId
The user being unfollowed	targetUserId	DELETE /unfollow/:targetUserId
Viewing someone's profile	profileUserId	GET /profile/:profileUserId
Friend/following/follower	otherUserId	For generic user-to-user action

üí¨ Chat & Messaging
Purpose	Name	Example
Message receiver	receiverId	POST /chat/send/:receiverId
Chat partner (friend)	friendId	DELETE /chat/remove/:friendId
Chat room ID	chatId	GET /chat/:chatId/messages

üì∑ Post, Comment, Like
Purpose	Name	Notes
Post identifier	postId	All post-related actions
Comment identifier	commentId	Nested under post or as separate route
Like identifier	likeId	If needed for DELETE or lookup

üîî Notifications
Purpose	Name	Example
Notification ID	notificationId	DELETE /notifications/:notificationId
User being notified	targetUserId	If notification is triggered by action

‚úÖ Summary Rules
Use userId only for the logged-in user

Use contextual names (targetUserId, receiverId, friendId) for others

Be specific: postId, commentId, chatId, etc.

Don‚Äôt reuse userId for multiple people in the same function ‚Äî that gets confusing fast
